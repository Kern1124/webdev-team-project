# pb138-Newspaper

This project was a group effort for a web dev university course assignment

I mostly worked on the backend - image uploading, endpoints, database queries, etc...

The final version of the frontend is in the branch "frontend" and the final version of the backend is in the branch "backend", frontend and backend are therefore separated into different branches.

The website itself is a simple newspaper website that allows users to authenticate and post articles/comments. Articles are posted in different newspapers under different publishers, in order for an article to be visible, it has to be approved by the director of said newspaper first.
